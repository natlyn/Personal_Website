                    <h3>Overview</h3><br/> <br/> 

                        A common debate between developers regarding the two web services SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST(Representational State Transfer) can make it confusing to decide when to use either. Developers have stood behind their preferred selections based on some factors including the developerâ€™s preferred programming language, use of environment, and the nitty gritty needs of their application. <br/> <br/> 

                        Though the difference seems clear, as REST is more of an architectural structure than the standardized implementation protocol SOAP, they both can provide the same functions. While you will find no wrong or right answer to the question of the best, you should benefit from an overview that explores each web service to find when using one seems more optimal than using the other. <br/> <br/> 


                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Using SOAP</h3><br/> <br/>

                    A protocol for exchanging data, SOAP is standardized and needs to follow a specific convention. The requests between client and server returns an envelope where you can find the optional header that may include a set of encoding rules or metadata, and the body where the actual message is stored. This envelope, when sent over either HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), or even JMS(Java Messaging Service), returns an XML document. <br/> <br/>
                    
                    A well established and well designed protocol with rules of implementation, SOAP shows as optimal for the following options:

                    <ul>
                       
                        <li> Enterprise- structured environments. </li>
                        <li> When you need more stateful operations. </li>
                        <li> To run operations asynchronously. </li>
                        
                    </ul><br/> 

                    Worthy to note, W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) supports SOAP, extending the usage of WS(Web Services) extensions including WSS or Web Services Security. This extendability suits as a helpful resource for developers. <br/> <br/> 

                </p>

                <p>
                   <h3> Using REST</h3> <br/> 

                    Some developers may argue that they prefer using REST because it supports other programming languages including JSON. Known for the ability to use CRUD operations in the form of POST, GET, PUT and DELETE, REST makes it easier to navigate the browser. Unlike the standardized protocol structure of SOAP, REST is all architectural. Thanks to this architectural structure, a client can easily access a resource through its identifiable URI(Uniform Resource Identifier).<br/> <br/> 

                    REST is optimal for various options:
                    <ul>
                       
                        <li> When you need caching capabilities to reduce communication with the back end and improve overall performance. </li>
                        <li> For stateless operations. </li>
                        <li> To reduce bandwidth, as you can use a simple URL for access.</li>
                        <li>If you need more flexibility with public APIs.</li>
                             
                    </ul><br/> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Summary</h3> <br/> <br/> 

                    Though different in structure as SOAP is a protocol and REST, an architectural framework, you can see how their basic characteristics can adapt to a number of your web service needs. The best way to determine the one you will prefer is to lay out your project plans and align them with the optimal choice. If time and opportunity permits, try them both and join in on the debate. <br/>
