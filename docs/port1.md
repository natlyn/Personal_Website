# How To Play Tic-Tac-Toe

**A Short Guide**

## Summary

A fun game and a great way to pass time with a player, tic-tac-toe (or “X” and “O”) is a simple two-player game for all ages. Younger players can learn the idea of rules and sportsmanship while older players use it as an exercise to interact with each other. This short guide gives background on the game, how to play, and gets you started on your first match.

## Learning Some Background

Dating back to the first century BC, Romans played tic-tac-toe (then called “terni lapilli”), which translates to “three little stones.” Though the rules were different then, the concept is similar to modern tic-tac-toe.

In the 16th century English version, the game was referred to as “tit-tat-toe.” Variations of the game have developed through the centuries but the goal has always remained the same: to win with **three in a row**.

## Setting Up the Game

Tic-tac-toe is popular for its simple nature and does not require much:

- Two players
- A blank sheet of paper
- A pen or pencil
- Good sportsmanship

Decide who plays first and who will be “X” or “O.” The objective is to place three of your marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Playing the Game

1. Draw a 3×3 grid on paper.
2. The first player places their mark (X or O) in any empty cell.
3. Players alternate placing marks in empty cells.
4. The game continues until one player gets three in a row or all cells are filled (a draw).

The first player often has an advantage, but a good second move can still win or force a draw. You can also play digitally via a web or mobile app.

## Have Fun

The best part of the game is having fun and learning how the other player thinks. Play multiple rounds and enjoy the challenge.
