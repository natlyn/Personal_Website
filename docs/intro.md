# About me

I am a technical writer with 10+ years of experience producing clear, task-focused documentation for cybersecurity, cloud, information-security, title insurance, and B2B products or services. I write for technical and non-technical audiences and help teams ship dependable documentation that reduces support load and accelerates onboarding.

- 10+ years authoring developer and user-facing documentation (APIs, SDKs, tutorials, runbooks).
- Experienced leading docs-as-code and CI-driven publishing workflows (Docusaurus, GitHub Actions).
- Strong cross-functional collaboration with Product, Engineering, Support, and Marketing teams.
